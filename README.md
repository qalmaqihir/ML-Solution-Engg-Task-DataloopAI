# ML-Solution-Engg-Task-DataloopAI 🚀

## Overview 📚

This repository contains the code and documentation for **ML-Solution-Engg-Task-DataloopAI**, which consists of two parts: 
Part 1 (UI and Data Preparation) and Part 2 (SDK Scripting).

**Part 1 (UI and Data Preparation) 🖼️:**

In Part 1, I utilized the Dataloop AI platform to perform various tasks related to data annotation and preparation. The key steps in this part include:

- **Data Uploading** 📂: I uploaded the dataset files required for annotation to the Dataloop AI platform. I chose a dataset with 3 different categories of images (cat, dog & bird)

- **Creating Annotation Categories** 🏷️: I defined and created the annotation categories [cat,dog & bird] required for the project. These categories helped in labeling and annotating the data effectively.

- **Annotation** 🖋️: We used the platform's user-friendly UI to annotate the data, applying labels and bounding boxes to specific objects nd regions of interest within the images. So, I applied three annotation techniques namely **Classification, Semantic Segmentation and Box Annotation** from the Recipe.

- **Quality Control** 🧐: To ensure the quality and accuracy of annotations, I performed quality control checks, reviewing and validating the annotations made by annotators.

- **Exporting Annotations** 📤: Finally, I exported the annotated data in a format suitable for machine learning model training, ensuring it was ready for use in our AI projects.

**Part 2 (SDK Scripting) 🐍:**

Part 2 of the project involves the use of Dataloop's Python SDK to automate various tasks related to managing datasets, annotations, and data retrieval. The key scripts included in this part are:

- **Script_draft1.py** 📜: This script demonstrates how to use the Dataloop SDK to upload data, create annotation categories, and perform basic dataset management tasks.

- **Script_draft2.py** 📜: This script builds upon the previous one and showcases more advanced features of the SDK. Here I tried different code snippets to avoid the errors.
  
- **Script_draft2.ipynb** 📜: This script builds upon the previous one and showcases all the questions in detials with headings and subheadings. Moreover, here I explore many other attributes of the classes and objects used. I optimized my code fully here.

- **Script_final.py** 📜: This script represents the final version of our SDK automation. It incorporates all the functionalities required for our project, including data upload, annotation management, and dataset querying. And all the tasks from Part 2 are done.
